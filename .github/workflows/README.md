## 🎯 Signal Generation Logic

### PCR-Based Signals
| PCR OI | PCR Volume | Signal | Action |
|--------|------------|--------|---------|
| > 1.5 | > 1.2 | **STRONG BUY** | Buy Call Options |
| > 1.2 | Any | **BUY** | Buy Call Options |
| < 0.6 | < 0.8 | **STRONG BUY** | Buy Put Options |
| < 0.8 | Any | **BUY** | Buy Put Options |
| 0.8-1.2 | Any | **HOLD** | No Action |

### Strike Selection Priority
1. **ATM Strike** - Maximum Gamma, highest liquidity
2. **Near-ATM** (±1 strike) - Balanced risk-reward
3. **Other ±5 strikes** - With distance-based scoring
